Horizon a very advanced economy discord bot that has everything you'll ever need




# == Setup == 
```js
since this bot is in v5 and you want to make your own commanda with embeds here are the changes 

$description[] == $description[1;]
$title[] == $title[1;]
$footer[]== footer[1;]
$color[] == $color[1;]
$author[] == $author[1;]
$thumbnail[] == $thumbnail[1;]
$addTimeStamp == $addTimeStamp[1;ms]

== My point ==
everything that had to do with embeds has changed heres an example
module.exports = {
name: "test",
code: `
$title[1;Testing]
$author[1;Also testing]
$footer[1;This command is a test]
$thumbnail[1; < image link > ]
$color[1;00ff00]
$addTimeStamp[1;ms]
$description[1;This repository is owned by Snipedprox aka lexi]
```
